# Empiria Trade Frontend Web Application

Angular-based front-end application for the Empiria Trade Frontend.

## Quick start

This project is being built with Angular version 16.2.1 and TypeScript 4.9.3.

It uses [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), so both the CLI and generated project, have dependencies that require Node 16.14.0 or higher, together with NPM 8.5.0 or higher.

**Make sure you have Node version >= 16.14.0 and NPM >= 8.5.0**

**Then install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** (globally if possible), ensuring that you have installed **version 16** or higher.

```bash
# install Angular CLI globally
npm install -g @angular/cli

# check Angular CLI, Angular and TypeScript versions
ng -v
```

After that, please download and install this repo:

```bash
# clone (or fork) this repo
git clone https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Trade.Frontend

# change directory
cd Empiria.Trade.Frontend

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# Use Angular CLI to start the server
ng serve --open
```

By default, you have to navigate to [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024) to see the application running.
